# Resource efficient domain adaptive pre-training
This repository contains the complete code for reproducing the results of the study "Resource-efficient domain adaptive pre-training for medical images." Please download the arXiv pre-print of the study [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13280).<br>
## General guidelines
Run the jupyter notebook files in the order suggested here. Also, run the cells from top to bottom within each notebook file. The tasks you need to perform to reproduce the results in the study are:
<ol>
    <li>Dataset preparation</li>
    <li>Domain adaptive pre-training (DAPT)</li>
    <li>Features extraction</li>
    <li>Downstream classification and evaluation</li>
    <li>Robustness check</li>
    <li>Visualization of the results</li>
</ol>

### 1. Dataset preparation
All the datasets are converted to .npy files (where each array element has the data type of float16). To do so, all the images/slices are read and stored inside NumPy arrays (images/slices of each class are stored in a different array). These arrays are saved as .npy files.
The code files BraTS_To_NPY.ipynb, CE_MRI_To_NPY.ipynb, HMS_To_NPY.ipynb, and Kaggle_BTTC_To_NPY.ipynb in the "Dataset preparation" folder contain code to save the datasets BraTS 2020 (T1 sequence), contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Kaggle brain tumor type classification (Kaggle BTTC), respectively as .npy files.

### 2. Domain adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
The following table summarizes the training protocol for all the strategies for the DAPT (please see the paper for further details):
